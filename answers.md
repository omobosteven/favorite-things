> I spent 3 weeks / 120 hours working on the coding test.

> If I had more time, I will add the ability for users to update and delete a category. Also, I would make the application responsive across all devices.

- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

> Identify what parts of the application are slow and also what use cases are slow.

> Identify what time the application is slow (sometimes it might be caused by some process that runs in the background at a specified time)

> Have the DBA/System Admin/Network Admin to run stats on their various systems and reports for the times your app is slow, file systems and resource consumption and network traffic between the various servers.

> Prepare example testdata and usage scenerios to be run.

> Let it run and burn some CPU cycles, and then gather general system statistics.
